<p>My name is Huljan.I am 18 years old.I was born in Tirana the capital city of Albania and i lived there the best 18 years of my life.I came in New York city 3 months ago "July 28 2024" to study and follow my dream since i was a kid.
My major is Graphic design and Multimedia programming.I am studying at BMCC,which is located in downtown Manhattan.I can't wait to finish college and start working as a Graphic designer.But before i would like to do bachelor and study fashion design cause i am also passionate about fashion and designers.When i finish college i may be going back to Albania and practice my profession there and bring there another mindset from New York about this job,a mindset that they are not used to.
My favorite things to do here in New York are just getting a cup of coffe and wander around Manhattan beautiful streets and maybe do a little shopping in Soho and also trying different restaurants to have a good meal.I like cozy places especially now in fall and winter.I like a lot to watch movies especially old romantic movies and i like a good thriller(i am obssesed with movies).For me its important to say that my favorite brand is Hermes and Loro Piana and in genreal i like italian brands.I would also always choose Italy for vacation.
Generally these are the things that i like summarized in 3 paragraphs.</p>
